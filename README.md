# Code when I read [JS Basics Handbook](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-for-beginners/)

The purpose of this book is to teach me basic knowledge of JavaScript.
I don't need to run code in browser.

All code in this book can be run in a terminal using node (so perfect for neovim).
